# Object Lessons in Boredom 
## Course Goals  
- To learn how to be more fully, completely and beautifully bored 
- To learn how to express our boredom in various forms, including song, dance and word
- To learn which objects are the most and least boring, and to be able to judge these objects consistently on a numerical scale

## Readings  
- *Moby Dick*, the chapter on all the different kinds of whales

The point of this course is that I'm a little bored right now, and a little sleepy, and I just want to admit that to myself in the hope that admitting it will make me, at the very least, less sleepy. It is the next morning and I am still sleepy.
